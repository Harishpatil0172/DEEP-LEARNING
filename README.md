# DEEP-LEARNING
# 1.Plant Disease Prediction:

In this project we will create a Convolutional Neural Network which will be able to predict whether a plant is suffering from a disease. We will use different layers and other hyperparameters for building, training and testing this classifictaion model.We will be using tensorflow and keras for this project.

### model accuracy = 93.65%
## Conclusion
We started with loading the dataset into google colab using google drive and visualizing the images. Normalizing is an important step when working with any type of dataset. After that we created a CNN Model which is further used for predicting the plant diseases using the image supplied to model. This model is highly beneficial as it can be used by different agricultural firms and farmers to increase their yield and stop wastage of crops due to disease.

# 2.Vehicle Detect-Count:

In this project, we will be working on detecting and counting vehicles in a given image or a video. We will be using OpenCV for image processing and Haar cascade which is used for object detection.

## Conclusion:
We started with downloading the image we will be working on and performed different operations on that image. We saw how we can use haar cascade which is used for object detection. We saw how different haar cascade is used for car detection, bus detection. Similarly, you can use many pretrained haar cascades for different object detection.

## Scope:
As haar cascade is used for object detection we have a very vast scope for this project. It can be used for any type of object detection. We can also create our own custom haar cascade for specific object.


# 3.Face Swap:

In this project, we will be using #opencv and #dlib to extract faces of human-beings from a given image. We will use a pretrained model to extract landmarks from the faces.

## Conclusion

We started with downloading the pretrained model for face landmark and download the images from the internet on which we will work. Next we used CV2 and Dlib for preprocessing the images and used different functionalities to make reach to the end which is swapping the face of destination image with source image.

## Scope

This project can be used for learning and understanding different concepts of computer vision. This project can be use to build Augmented Reality applications like Snapchat, etc.
